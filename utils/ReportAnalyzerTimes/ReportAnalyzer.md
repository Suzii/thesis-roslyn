#Running MSBuild with ReportAnalyzers
This simple guide explains how to run MSBuild with so that the compiler outputs the statistics about analyzers' execution times.

As per https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/master/docs/analyzers/Report%20Analyzer%20Format.md, it should be possible to run the compiler (csc.exr) with `/ReportAnalyzer` switch and all the stats should be there. 
Not so easy for `MSBuild`, though... 
The MSBuild internally uses the csc.ex, therefore, it should be (somehow) possible to switch it on. 
As it turns out, the MSBuild official documentation (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms164311.aspx) does not contain any information on that matter.

**TL;DR;**

```MSBuild.exe /t:Clean,Build /p:ReportAnalyzer=True /verbosity:diagnostic .\SampleProject.sln > msbuild-output.txt```
 
Be carefull to redirect the output and prepare yourself for the output file to be rather large (~100MB-500MB). 
Parameter `/p:ReportAnalyzer=True` turns `/ReportAnalyzer` for `csc.exe`, but only `/verbosity:diagnostic` makes it appear in the output itself.

NOTE: If the diagnostics are only warnings, build seems to ignore them after first run, therefore the Clean target.

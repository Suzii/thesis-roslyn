DEPLOY 16.3.2017
674 warnings after initial deployment of both packages. 
Most of them are SystemIO.
In IO, AzureStorage, AmazonStorage projects - setting SystemIO analyzer severity to None (https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/master/docs/compilers/Rule%20Set%20Format.md)
After that, 448 warnings remaining.
Applying old BH config - suppressing System.IO in:
- Search.Lucene3
- WinService
- HealthMonitoringService
- etc.
(Why do we need CMS.IO ??? (https://docs.kentico.com/k10/custom-development/working-with-physical-files-using-the-api))
- then getting rid of Hacking of SystemIO rule (named import + use method from System.IO): 
* some things were just old, and CMS.IO was implemented in the meantime
* we were able to delete hacks around IOExceptions and Streams which needed to be hacked around due to old BH not being able to white list them

* SeekOrigin - was additionally white listed from SystemIOAnalyzer as there was extensive usage with Streams (+/- 30 warnings down)
* IndexOf and whole string comparisons and manipulations - tooooo many discovered usages without StringComparison, which could not have been found by old BH
* Equals no way to find out whether it is called on string so no way to by found by old BH, also many usages detedcted by new BH

* about 130 false positive errors that should have been on excluded path (ValidationHelperGetAnalyzer), amendment to implementation, errors are gone

* in helper files that wrap the actually forbidden methods, we used pragmas on whole file explicitely in the code


=========
build boxes and Update 3 -> needed for right version of code analysis dlls (https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/6737
